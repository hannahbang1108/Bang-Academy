# Bang Academy

This project is an educational website called Bang Academy that covers Boolean Laws.

## Description

The website is split into 3 sections: Boolean Symbols, Truth Tables, and Boolean Laws. The Boolean Symbols section and the Truth Table section are included because they are
prerequisites you need to understand Boolean laws. The Boolean Symbols section covers boolean statements, expressions, operators, and real-life uses. The Truth Tables section 
further explains operators by introducing what a truth table is and showing how to visually represent AND, OR, and NOT. The Boolean Laws section uses everything covered in the 
previous two sections to go over all the Boolean laws we covered in class. Each section includes two videos covering content, two original practice problems, and a summary of the content. 
There is also a general description of the unit at the top of the page. The website and practice problems were coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the videos are linked externally 
from my Google Drive.
